          I am a watercolor artist and I love to paint and teach watercolors. I
          paint landscapes, people, cityscapes, animals and birds. I used to be
          an web developer working in coporate companies but I felt something
          missing there and was drawn to arts and then decided to rekindle my
          childhood interest in arts. As a child I used to do pencil sketching
          but when I started in 2018 at an age of 32, I found watercolors very
          attractive. I decided to go for it but failed miserably at it. My love
          hate relationship with watercolors carrried on for few years and my
          art quality grew gradually and the stage where it is now you can see
          in my paintings. Through this painting journey, I learnt one important
          lesson, however bad are you at something, if you perserve you can see
          improvements you have not dreamt of.

          I also have deep interest in spirituality. I do regular yoga and
          meditation and have comparitively better understanding of life in
          general and I help people with their problems. Im other words, I have
          done a lot of self healing work and help people with by teaching them
          self healing.
