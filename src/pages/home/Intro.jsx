          I am a watercolor artist and I love to paint and teach watercolors. I
          paint landscapes, people, cityscapes, animals and birds. I have been
          working as a web developer in coporate companies but I felt something
          missing there and was drawn to arts and then decided to rekindle my
          childhood interest in arts. As a child I used to do pencil sketching
          but when I re-started in 2018 at an age of 32, I found watercolors
          very attractive. I decided to go for it but failed miserably at it. My
          love hate relationship with watercolors carrried on for few years and
          my art quality grew gradually to the stage where it is now. Through
          this painting journey, I learnt one important lesson, however bad are
          you at something, if you perserve you can see improvements you have
          not dreamt of. I have also tried my hand at filmmaking in the past and
          have made a few short films.

          I also have deep interest in spirituality. I do regular yoga and
          meditation, read ventantic literature and philosophy and have decent
          understanding of life in general and I love to help people with their
          life problems. In other words, I have done a lot of self healing work
          and help people by teaching them self healing.
